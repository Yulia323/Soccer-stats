## Project setup

For the start you need to create .env file in your project root(not src).

For the app to work you need to add startup configuration in the .env file.

Required variables: REACT_APP_API_KEY (This is the api access key to football-data.org.). 
That's all what you need to get started, then you can run the 'npm start' script, and it should work.

## About project

Since I don't have a layout for the homepage, the application starts from the leagues page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
